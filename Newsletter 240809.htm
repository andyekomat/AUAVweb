      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">All Freeview boxes, Freeview+ digital TV recorders and 
        digital TVs will need to be retuned for viewers to carrying on receiving 
        all of the services available to them, including Five, ITV4 and BBC Radio 
        stations.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">This retune is required ahead of an upgrade of the Freeview 
        service and WITHOUT A RETUNE on or after the 30th September, viewers WILL 
        NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS THESE CHANNELS.</font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">To encourage regular retuning and to make 
        sure viewers are receiving all Freeview channels and services available 
        to them, Freeview is launching its 'REMEMBER TO RETUNE' campaign. </font></p>

      <p><font color="#0000FF" size="4">As of Wednesday the 2nd of September the 
        Wrekin transmitter is being Maintained and the analogue channels will 
        suffer for a little while, maybe about a week untill repairs are finished. 
        We are under the impression that this is due to a replacement of antenna 
        top ready for the digital switch in 2011. We'll try to keep you posted 
        on further developments as we hear them.</font></p>
